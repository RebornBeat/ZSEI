# ZSEI Document Analysis Methodology

## Introduction

The ZSEI Document Analysis Methodology provides a comprehensive framework for extracting deep understanding from text documents through progressive multi-phase analysis. Unlike traditional text analysis approaches that focus on surface-level features, this methodology implements a sophisticated understanding process that captures semantic meaning, structural relationships, and contextual significance while maintaining memory efficiency for documents of any size.

Think of this methodology as a systematic approach to reading and understanding documents the way an expert human analyst would, but with the consistency and thoroughness that only automated systems can provide. The methodology progresses from initial document survey through increasingly sophisticated levels of analysis, ultimately producing a complete understanding that can be queried, compared, and leveraged for various applications.

The methodology is designed to work within the constraints of both large language models (LLMs) and small language models (SLMs) by using adaptive chunking, progressive analysis, and intelligent memory management. This ensures that even documents too large to fit in a model's context window can be analyzed thoroughly and accurately.

## Core Principles

The Document Analysis Methodology is built on seven fundamental principles that guide every aspect of the analysis process:

**Progressive Understanding** represents the idea that complex documents cannot be understood all at once. Instead, we build understanding layer by layer, starting with high-level structure and progressively deepening our analysis. This mirrors how human experts approach complex documents - first getting an overview, then diving into details, and finally synthesizing insights.

**Complete Context Preservation** ensures that no important relationships or dependencies are lost during analysis. When we analyze a document in chunks due to memory constraints, we maintain awareness of how each chunk relates to the whole document and to other documents in the corpus.

**Memory-Efficient Processing** acknowledges the practical constraints of working with large documents and limited computational resources. The methodology adapts its approach based on available memory and processing power, ensuring that analysis can proceed regardless of document size.

**Semantic Extraction** goes beyond simple keyword extraction to understand the meaning, intent, and implications of text. This involves recognizing patterns, understanding context, and inferring relationships that may not be explicitly stated.

**Vector Representation** transforms textual understanding into mathematical representations that can be efficiently stored, searched, and compared. This enables semantic search and comparison capabilities that traditional text analysis cannot provide.

**Relationship Tracking** maintains awareness of connections between different parts of documents and between different documents. This includes explicit references as well as implicit thematic and conceptual relationships.

**Architectural Inference** recognizes that documents have implicit structures and patterns that reflect their purpose and genre. By understanding these patterns, we can extract insights that go beyond the explicit content.

## Multi-Phase Analysis Process

The methodology implements analysis through five distinct phases, each building upon the insights gained in previous phases. This progressive approach ensures thorough understanding while maintaining computational efficiency.

### Phase 1: Initial Document Survey

The first phase establishes foundational understanding of the document through rapid structural analysis and content sampling. This phase answers fundamental questions about what type of document we're analyzing and how it's organized.

During this phase, we begin by extracting the document's raw content from whatever format it's stored in, whether that's PDF, Word, HTML, or plain text. The extraction process preserves structural information like headings, paragraphs, tables, and formatting that will be important for later analysis phases.

```rust
pub async fn survey_document(
    document_path: &Path,
    config: &AnalysisConfig,
    llm: &dyn Model
) -> Result<DocumentSurvey> {
    // Begin by extracting all content while preserving structure
    // This step handles various file formats and normalizes them
    let content = extract_document_content(document_path, &config.extraction_config)?;
    
    // Determine what type of document we're working with
    // This classification guides subsequent analysis approaches
    let document_type = identify_document_type(&content, llm).await?;
    
    // Analyze the document's organizational structure
    // This includes headings, sections, paragraphs, and other structural elements
    let structure = analyze_document_structure(&content, &document_type, config)?;
    
    // Extract metadata that provides context for analysis
    // This includes creation date, author, title, and other document properties
    let metadata = extract_document_metadata(&content, &document_type)?;
    
    // Identify the main topics and themes at a high level
    // This provides an overview of what the document covers
    let topics = identify_main_topics(&content, &document_type, config, llm).await?;
    
    // Assess how difficult the document is to read and understand
    // This informs how we approach subsequent analysis phases
    let readability = analyze_document_readability(&content, &document_type)?;
    
    // Create a comprehensive survey that guides subsequent phases
    let survey = DocumentSurvey {
        document_path: document_path.to_path_buf(),
        document_type,
        structure,
        metadata,
        topics,
        readability,
        content_sample: extract_content_sample(&content, config.sample_size),
    };
    
    Ok(survey)
}
```

The document type identification process is crucial because different types of documents require different analysis approaches. A legal contract needs different analysis than a research paper, which needs different analysis than a creative story. The methodology maintains specialized analysis pathways for various document types while sharing common foundational techniques.

Document structure analysis extracts the hierarchical organization of the content. This includes not just obvious structural elements like headings and sections, but also implicit organizational patterns like argument structure in persuasive writing or narrative structure in stories. Understanding structure helps us know how to navigate the document and how different parts relate to each other.

The readability analysis evaluates factors like sentence complexity, vocabulary difficulty, and conceptual density. This information helps us adjust our analysis approach - documents with high complexity may require more sophisticated semantic analysis, while simpler documents may benefit from more straightforward approaches.

### Phase 2: Semantic Content Analysis

The second phase delves deep into the meaning and intent of the document content. While the first phase focused on structure and organization, this phase focuses on understanding what the document is trying to communicate and how it goes about that communication.

```rust
pub async fn analyze_document_semantics(
    document: &Document,
    survey: &DocumentSurvey,
    config: &SemanticAnalysisConfig,
    llm: &dyn Model
) -> Result<SemanticAnalysis> {
    let mut analysis = SemanticAnalysis::new();
    
    // Understand the fundamental purpose of this document
    // Why was it written? What is it trying to achieve?
    let purpose = analyze_document_purpose(document, survey, llm).await?;
    analysis.set_purpose(purpose);
    
    // Extract the major themes and how they're developed
    // Themes are the big ideas that run throughout the document
    let themes = analyze_document_themes(document, survey, config, llm).await?;
    analysis.set_themes(themes);
    
    // Identify key concepts and how they're defined and used
    // Concepts are the building blocks of understanding in the document
    let concepts = extract_document_concepts(document, survey, config, llm).await?;
    analysis.set_concepts(concepts);
    
    // Analyze how arguments are structured and developed
    // This applies to all documents, not just explicitly argumentative ones
    let argumentation = analyze_argumentation_structure(document, survey, config, llm).await?;
    analysis.set_argumentation(argumentation);
    
    // Understand the emotional tone and attitude of the document
    // This includes both explicit sentiment and subtle emotional undercurrents
    let sentiment = analyze_document_sentiment(document, survey, config)?;
    analysis.set_sentiment(sentiment);
    
    // Identify the document's position on key issues or topics
    // What stance does the document take? What does it advocate for or against?
    let stance = analyze_document_stance(document, survey, config, llm).await?;
    analysis.set_stance(stance);
    
    // Extract and classify named entities mentioned in the document
    // This includes people, places, organizations, dates, and other specific references
    let entities = extract_document_entities(document, survey, config)?;
    analysis.set_entities(entities);
    
    // Create a comprehensive semantic summary that captures the essence
    let summary = generate_semantic_summary(&analysis, config, llm).await?;
    analysis.set_summary(summary);
    
    Ok(analysis)
}
```

Purpose analysis goes beyond simple topic identification to understand the communicative intent of the document. A research paper might have the purpose of presenting new findings and convincing readers of their validity. A technical manual might have the purpose of enabling users to successfully complete complex tasks. A legal contract might have the purpose of clearly defining rights and obligations to prevent disputes.

Thematic analysis identifies the major ideas that run throughout the document and how they're developed. Themes are often implicit rather than explicitly stated. For example, a business report might have explicit topics like "quarterly sales figures" but implicit themes like "organizational growth" or "market adaptation challenges."

Concept extraction identifies the key ideas, terms, and frameworks that the document uses to build understanding. This includes both explicitly defined concepts and implicitly used ones. The methodology tracks how concepts are introduced, developed, and interconnected throughout the document.

Argumentation analysis applies to all documents, not just those that are explicitly argumentative. Every document makes some kind of case for its own validity and importance. A technical manual argues that following its procedures will lead to successful outcomes. A story argues that its characters and events are worth the reader's attention and emotional investment.

### Phase 3: Relationship Mapping

The third phase focuses on understanding how different parts of the document relate to each other and how the document relates to other documents and external knowledge. This phase is crucial for building comprehensive understanding that goes beyond isolated analysis of individual sections.

```rust
pub async fn map_document_relationships(
    document: &Document,
    semantic_analysis: &SemanticAnalysis,
    corpus: Option<&DocumentCorpus>,
    config: &RelationshipMappingConfig,
    llm: &dyn Model
) -> Result<RelationshipMap> {
    let mut relationship_map = RelationshipMap::new();
    
    // Map how different sections of the document relate to each other
    // This includes logical flow, dependency relationships, and thematic connections
    let section_relations = map_section_relationships(document, semantic_analysis, config, llm).await?;
    relationship_map.set_section_relations(section_relations);
    
    // Map relationships between concepts within the document
    // How do different ideas build on each other or conflict with each other?
    let concept_relations = map_concept_relationships(document, semantic_analysis, config, llm).await?;
    relationship_map.set_concept_relations(concept_relations);
    
    // Map the structure of arguments and how they support each other
    // This includes premise-conclusion relationships and evidential support
    let argument_relations = map_argument_relationships(document, semantic_analysis, config, llm).await?;
    relationship_map.set_argument_relations(argument_relations);
    
    // If we're analyzing multiple documents, map relationships between them
    // This includes citations, thematic similarities, and contradictions
    if let Some(corpus) = corpus {
        let cross_doc_relations = map_cross_document_relationships(
            document,
            semantic_analysis,
            corpus,
            config,
            llm
        ).await?;
        relationship_map.set_cross_doc_relations(cross_doc_relations);
    }
    
    // Create a visual representation of the relationship network
    // This helps humans understand complex relationship patterns
    let visualization = generate_relationship_visualization(&relationship_map, config)?;
    relationship_map.set_visualization(visualization);
    
    Ok(relationship_map)
}
```

Section relationship mapping identifies how different parts of the document connect to create a coherent whole. This includes obvious connections like "Section B builds on the foundation established in Section A" as well as subtle connections like "Section C provides a contrasting perspective to Section A that helps illuminate the complexity of the issue."

Concept relationship mapping tracks how ideas relate to each other within the document. Some relationships are hierarchical (concept A is a type of concept B), some are causal (concept A leads to concept B), some are contradictory (concept A conflicts with concept B), and some are supportive (concept A provides evidence for concept B).

Argument relationship mapping analyzes how different claims, evidence, and reasoning connect to form the document's overall argumentative structure. Even non-argumentative documents have implicit argumentative structures - they make claims about what's important, what's true, and what readers should understand or do.

Cross-document relationship mapping becomes crucial when analyzing collections of documents. This includes explicit relationships like citations and references, as well as implicit relationships like thematic similarities, contradictory viewpoints, or complementary information.

### Phase 4: Vector Representation

The fourth phase transforms our understanding of the document into mathematical vector representations that enable efficient storage, retrieval, and comparison. This phase bridges the gap between human-readable understanding and machine-queryable data structures.

```rust
pub async fn generate_document_embeddings(
    document: &Document,
    semantic_analysis: &SemanticAnalysis,
    relationship_map: &RelationshipMap,
    config: &EmbeddingConfig,
    llm: &dyn Model
) -> Result<DocumentEmbeddings> {
    let mut embeddings = DocumentEmbeddings::new();
    
    // Create a single vector that represents the entire document
    // This captures the overall meaning and character of the document
    let doc_embedding = generate_document_embedding(document, semantic_analysis, config, llm).await?;
    embeddings.set_document_embedding(doc_embedding);
    
    // Create vectors for each major section of the document
    // This enables section-level search and comparison
    let section_embeddings = generate_section_embeddings(document, semantic_analysis, config, llm).await?;
    embeddings.set_section_embeddings(section_embeddings);
    
    // Create vectors for key concepts identified in the document
    // This enables concept-based search and analysis
    let concept_embeddings = generate_concept_embeddings(document, semantic_analysis, config, llm).await?;
    embeddings.set_concept_embeddings(concept_embeddings);
    
    // Create vectors that represent relationships between different elements
    // This enables relationship-based search and analysis
    let relationship_embeddings = generate_relationship_embeddings(relationship_map, config, llm).await?;
    embeddings.set_relationship_embeddings(relationship_embeddings);
    
    // Build a searchable index from all the embeddings
    // This enables fast semantic search across all levels of the document
    let search_index = build_embedding_search_index(&embeddings, config)?;
    embeddings.set_search_index(search_index);
    
    Ok(embeddings)
}
```

Document-level embeddings capture the overall character and meaning of the entire document in a single vector. This enables comparisons between documents and allows us to find documents that are semantically similar even if they don't share specific keywords.

Section-level embeddings allow for more granular analysis and retrieval. Instead of searching entire documents, we can find specific sections that are relevant to a query. This is particularly useful for large documents where only certain parts may be relevant to a specific question.

Concept embeddings represent the key ideas and frameworks used in the document. This enables concept-based search where we can find documents or sections that discuss similar ideas, even if they use different terminology.

Relationship embeddings represent the connections between different elements in the document. This enables sophisticated queries like "find documents where concept A leads to concept B" or "find sections that provide evidence supporting argument C."

### Phase 5: Comprehensive Document Classification

The final phase synthesizes all previous analysis to provide comprehensive classification and categorization of the document. This phase answers questions about what type of document this is, who it's intended for, and how it fits into broader categories of knowledge and communication.

```rust
pub async fn classify_document(
    document: &Document,
    semantic_analysis: &SemanticAnalysis,
    embeddings: &DocumentEmbeddings,
    config: &ClassificationConfig,
    llm: &dyn Model
) -> Result<DocumentClassification> {
    let mut classification = DocumentClassification::new();
    
    // Determine the broad category of the document
    // Is it academic, business, legal, creative, technical, etc.?
    let category = determine_document_category(document, semantic_analysis, embeddings, config, llm).await?;
    classification.set_category(category);
    
    // Determine the specific genre within the category
    // Within academic documents: research paper, review article, thesis, etc.
    let genre = determine_document_genre(document, semantic_analysis, embeddings, config, llm).await?;
    classification.set_genre(genre);
    
    // Identify who the intended audience is
    // Experts, general public, students, practitioners, etc.
    let audience = determine_target_audience(document, semantic_analysis, embeddings, config, llm).await?;
    classification.set_audience(audience);
    
    // Assess the complexity and sophistication level
    // This affects how the document should be processed and presented
    let complexity = determine_complexity_level(document, semantic_analysis, embeddings, config)?;
    classification.set_complexity(complexity);
    
    // Identify the writing style and approach
    // Formal, informal, academic, conversational, technical, etc.
    let style = determine_writing_style(document, semantic_analysis, embeddings, config, llm).await?;
    classification.set_style(style);
    
    // Determine the level of formality
    // This affects appropriate response styles and processing approaches
    let formality = determine_formality_level(document, semantic_analysis, embeddings, config)?;
    classification.set_formality(formality);
    
    // Assess the level of subject matter expertise required
    // Novice, intermediate, expert, specialist levels
    let expertise_level = determine_expertise_level(document, semantic_analysis, embeddings, config, llm).await?;
    classification.set_expertise_level(expertise_level);
    
    // Generate a comprehensive classification report
    // This synthesizes all classification insights into a readable summary
    let report = generate_classification_report(&classification, config, llm).await?;
    classification.set_report(report);
    
    Ok(classification)
}
```

Document category classification places the document into broad functional categories that indicate its primary purpose and context. Academic documents serve different purposes than business documents, which serve different purposes than legal documents. This classification helps us understand what kind of analysis and processing approaches are most appropriate.

Genre classification provides more specific categorization within the broader category. For example, within academic documents, a research paper requires different analysis than a literature review, which requires different analysis than a theoretical essay. Each genre has its own conventions, structures, and evaluation criteria.

Audience identification helps us understand the assumptions the document makes about its readers. A document written for experts will use different language, assume different background knowledge, and employ different persuasive strategies than a document written for a general audience.

Complexity assessment evaluates multiple dimensions of difficulty including vocabulary sophistication, conceptual complexity, structural complexity, and reasoning complexity. This assessment helps guide subsequent processing and presentation of the document.

Writing style identification recognizes the communication approach used by the document. Academic writing follows different conventions than business writing, which follows different conventions than creative writing. Understanding style helps us interpret the document appropriately and generate appropriate responses.

## Memory-Efficient Processing Techniques

One of the key challenges in document analysis is handling documents that are too large to fit comfortably in the context window of language models or in available memory. The methodology implements several sophisticated techniques to handle this challenge while maintaining analytical quality.

### Adaptive Chunking Strategy

Adaptive chunking divides large documents into manageable pieces while preserving important contextual relationships. Unlike simple fixed-size chunking, adaptive chunking considers the document's structure and content to create meaningful divisions.

```rust
pub fn process_document_chunked<F, R>(
    document: &Document,
    processor: F,
    config: &ChunkingConfig
) -> Result<Vec<R>>
where
    F: Fn(&str) -> Result<R>,
{
    let mut results = Vec::new();
    let content = &document.content;
    
    // Monitor memory usage to adjust chunking strategy dynamically
    let memory_monitor = MemoryMonitor::new(config.target_memory_mb);
    
    // Start with a reasonable chunk size and adjust based on performance
    let mut chunk_size = config.initial_chunk_size;
    
    // Process the document in overlapping chunks to preserve context
    let mut position = 0;
    while position < content.len() {
        // Adjust chunk size based on current memory usage
        // If memory is constrained, use smaller chunks
        // If memory is abundant, use larger chunks for efficiency
        chunk_size = memory_monitor.calculate_optimal_chunk_size(chunk_size);
        
        // Find the best place to end the current chunk
        // We prefer natural boundaries like paragraph breaks
        let end = if position + chunk_size >= content.len() {
            content.len()
        } else {
            // Look for paragraph boundary near the target end position
            find_paragraph_boundary(content, position + chunk_size)
        };
        
        // Extract the chunk with some overlap from the previous chunk
        // Overlap helps maintain context across chunk boundaries
        let chunk_start = if position == 0 { 0 } else { position - config.overlap_size };
        let chunk = &content[chunk_start..end];
        
        // Process the chunk and store the result
        let result = processor(chunk)?;
        results.push(result);
        
        // Move to the next chunk position
        position = end;
    }
    
    Ok(results)
}
```

The adaptive chunking approach considers several factors when determining chunk boundaries. Natural paragraph breaks are preferred over arbitrary character positions because they preserve logical units of meaning. The methodology also considers the semantic density of different sections - areas with complex ideas may require smaller chunks to ensure thorough analysis.

Overlap between chunks is crucial for maintaining context. When a chunk ends in the middle of discussing a concept, the next chunk needs enough overlap to understand that concept's context. The methodology dynamically adjusts overlap size based on the complexity of the content and the relationships between adjacent sections.

### Document Streaming Architecture

For extremely large documents, the methodology can process content in a streaming fashion without loading the entire document into memory at once. This approach enables analysis of documents that are larger than available memory.

```rust
pub struct DocumentStreamer {
    file_path: PathBuf,
    buffer_size: usize,
    overlap_size: usize,
    current_context: StreamingContext,
}

impl DocumentStreamer {
    pub fn new(file_path: PathBuf, buffer_size: usize, overlap_size: usize) -> Self {
        DocumentStreamer {
            file_path,
            buffer_size,
            overlap_size,
            current_context: StreamingContext::new(),
        }
    }
    
    pub fn stream_document<F, R>(
        &mut self,
        processor: F
    ) -> Result<Vec<R>>
    where
        F: Fn(&str, &StreamingContext) -> Result<R>,
    {
        let mut results = Vec::new();
        
        // Open the document file for streaming
        let file = File::open(&self.file_path)?;
        let mut reader = BufReader::new(file);
        
        // Maintain a buffer for the current chunk
        let mut buffer = String::with_capacity(self.buffer_size);
        let mut overlap = String::new();
        
        // Process the document in streaming fashion
        loop {
            // Start each chunk with overlap from the previous chunk
            buffer.clear();
            buffer.push_str(&overlap);
            
            // Read additional content to fill the buffer
            let bytes_read = reader.by_ref()
                .take(self.buffer_size as u64)
                .read_to_string(&mut buffer)?;
            
            // If we've reached the end of the file and have no content, we're done
            if bytes_read == 0 && buffer.is_empty() {
                break;
            }
            
            // Process the current buffer with context from previous chunks
            let result = processor(&buffer, &self.current_context)?;
            results.push(result);
            
            // If we've reached the end of the file, we're done
            if bytes_read == 0 {
                break;
            }
            
            // Update context with information from the current chunk
            // This helps maintain understanding across chunk boundaries
            self.current_context.update_from_chunk(&buffer, &result);
            
            // Save overlap for the next chunk
            let overlap_start = buffer.len().saturating_sub(self.overlap_size);
            overlap = buffer[overlap_start..].to_string();
        }
        
        Ok(results)
    }
}
```

The streaming approach maintains a context object that accumulates understanding as it processes each chunk. This context includes key concepts, themes, and relationships identified in previous chunks, allowing each new chunk to be analyzed in the context of what came before.

The context update mechanism is crucial for maintaining coherent understanding across the entire document. As each chunk is processed, key insights are extracted and added to the running context. This ensures that later chunks can reference and build upon understanding developed from earlier chunks.

### Incremental Analysis Framework

For documents that are analyzed multiple times or updated frequently, the methodology supports incremental analysis that builds upon previous analysis results rather than starting from scratch each time.

```rust
pub async fn analyze_document_incrementally<F, Fut, R>(
    document_path: &Path,
    analyzer: F,
    config: &IncrementalAnalysisConfig,
    llm: &dyn Model,
    previous_analysis: Option<&DocumentAnalysis>
) -> Result<DocumentAnalysis>
where
    F: Fn(&str, &AnalysisContext, &dyn Model) -> Fut,
    Fut: Future<Output = Result<R>>,
{
    let mut analysis = if let Some(prev) = previous_analysis {
        // Start with previous analysis and update incrementally
        prev.clone()
    } else {
        // Start with fresh analysis
        DocumentAnalysis::new()
    };
    
    // Create document streamer for memory-efficient processing
    let mut streamer = DocumentStreamer::new(
        document_path.to_path_buf(),
        config.buffer_size,
        config.overlap_size
    );
    
    // Create analysis context that accumulates understanding
    let mut context = AnalysisContext::new();
    
    // If we have previous analysis, initialize context with that knowledge
    if let Some(prev) = previous_analysis {
        context.initialize_from_previous_analysis(prev);
    }
    
    // Set up checkpointing to handle long-running analysis
    let checkpointer = AnalysisCheckpointer::new(config.checkpoint_interval);
    
    // Process document in chunks
    let mut chunk_index = 0;
    let chunk_results = streamer.stream_document(|chunk, streaming_context| {
        // Create analysis context that combines streaming context with accumulated context
        let combined_context = context.combine_with_streaming_context(streaming_context);
        
        // Return chunk content and context for later processing
        Ok((chunk.to_string(), combined_context))
    })?;
    
    // Analyze each chunk with full context awareness
    for (chunk_content, chunk_context) in chunk_results {
        // Analyze the chunk with accumulated context
        let chunk_result = analyzer(&chunk_content, &chunk_context, llm).await?;
        
        // Update analysis with the new chunk result
        analysis.add_chunk_result(chunk_index, chunk_result);
        
        // Update context with insights from this chunk
        context.update_with_chunk_result(chunk_index, &analysis);
        
        // Create checkpoint periodically to enable recovery
        if checkpointer.should_checkpoint(chunk_index) {
            analysis.create_checkpoint(&context)?;
        }
        
        chunk_index += 1;
    }
    
    // Finalize analysis by synthesizing all chunk results
    analysis.finalize(context)?;
    
    Ok(analysis)
}
```

The incremental analysis framework is particularly valuable for documents that are updated frequently or for analysis workflows that need to be rerun with different parameters. Instead of completely reanalyzing unchanged portions of documents, the methodology can identify what has changed and focus computational resources on those areas.

The checkpointing system ensures that long-running analysis operations can be resumed if they're interrupted. This is particularly important for very large documents that might take hours to analyze completely. Checkpoints include both the current state of the analysis and the context information needed to resume processing.

## Zero-Shot Bolted Embedding Generation

The methodology implements a sophisticated embedding generation approach that combines structural and semantic understanding to create rich vector representations of document content.

### Bolted Embedding Architecture

Zero-shot bolted embeddings work by combining two different types of understanding: structural analysis that looks at the organization and format of the text, and semantic analysis that understands the meaning and intent of the content.

```rust
pub async fn generate_zero_shot_bolted_text_embedding(
    content: &str,
    context: &EmbeddingContext,
    llm: &dyn Model
) -> Result<BoltedEmbedding> {
    // First, generate an embedding based on structural features
    // This captures information about how the text is organized
    let structural_embedding = generate_structural_text_embedding(content, context)?;
    
    // Second, generate an embedding based on semantic understanding
    // This captures information about what the text means
    let semantic_prompt = create_semantic_analysis_prompt(content, context);
    let semantic_response = llm.generate(&semantic_prompt).await?;
    let semantic_embedding = generate_text_embedding(&semantic_response)?;
    
    // Combine the two embeddings using weighted averaging
    // The weights determine how much to emphasize structure vs. semantics
    let combined_vector = combine_vectors(
        &structural_embedding.vector,
        &semantic_embedding.vector,
        context.structural_weight,
        context.semantic_weight
    )?;
    
    // Create the final bolted embedding that contains both components
    let bolted_embedding = BoltedEmbedding {
        id: generate_id(),
        structural_component: structural_embedding,
        semantic_component: semantic_embedding,
        combined_vector,
        content_hash: calculate_content_hash(content),
        content_type: context.content_type.clone(),
        metadata: context.metadata.clone(),
    };
    
    Ok(bolted_embedding)
}

fn generate_structural_text_embedding(
    content: &str,
    context: &EmbeddingContext
) -> Result<Embedding> {
    // Extract features related to text structure
    let features = extract_text_structural_features(content, &context.content_type)?;
    
    // Convert structural features into a numerical vector
    let vector = convert_features_to_vector(&features)?;
    
    // Normalize the vector to ensure consistent scaling
    let normalized_vector = normalize_vector(&vector);
    
    // Create the structural embedding
    let embedding = Embedding {
        id: generate_id(),
        vector: normalized_vector,
        content_hash: calculate_content_hash(content),
        content_type: context.content_type.clone(),
        embedding_type: EmbeddingType::Structural,
        metadata: context.metadata.clone(),
    };
    
    Ok(embedding)
}
```

The structural embedding captures information about how the text is organized and formatted. This includes features like sentence length distribution, paragraph structure, use of headings and subheadings, presence of lists or tables, and other organizational patterns. These structural features often correlate with document type and purpose.

The semantic embedding captures the meaning and intent of the text. This is generated by using a language model to analyze the content and produce a description of its semantic properties, which is then converted into a vector representation. The semantic analysis looks at themes, concepts, sentiment, argumentation, and other meaning-related aspects.

The combination of structural and semantic embeddings creates a richer representation than either approach alone. Two documents might be semantically similar but structurally different (like a research paper and a blog post on the same topic), or structurally similar but semantically different (like two legal contracts for completely different purposes).

### Hierarchical Embedding Structure

The methodology generates embeddings at multiple levels of granularity to support different types of queries and analysis.

```rust
pub async fn generate_hierarchical_text_embeddings(
    document: &Document,
    analysis: &SemanticAnalysis,
    config: &EmbeddingConfig,
    llm: &dyn Model
) -> Result<HierarchicalEmbeddings> {
    let mut embeddings = HierarchicalEmbeddings::new();
    
    // Document-level embedding represents the entire document
    let document_context = EmbeddingContext::for_document(&document.content, config);
    let doc_embedding = generate_zero_shot_bolted_text_embedding(
        &document.content,
        &document_context,
        llm
    ).await?;
    embeddings.set_document_embedding(doc_embedding);
    
    // Section-level embeddings for major document sections
    for section in &document.sections {
        let section_context = EmbeddingContext::for_section(
            &section.content,
            &section.section_type,
            config
        );
        let section_embedding = generate_zero_shot_bolted_text_embedding(
            &section.content,
            &section_context,
            llm
        ).await?;
        embeddings.add_section_embedding(section.id.clone(), section_embedding);
    }
    
    // Paragraph-level embeddings for fine-grained analysis
    for paragraph in document.extract_paragraphs() {
        let paragraph_context = EmbeddingContext::for_paragraph(
            &paragraph.content,
            &paragraph.context_info,
            config
        );
        let paragraph_embedding = generate_zero_shot_bolted_text_embedding(
            &paragraph.content,
            &paragraph_context,
            llm
        ).await?;
        embeddings.add_paragraph_embedding(paragraph.id.clone(), paragraph_embedding);
    }
    
    // Concept-level embeddings for key ideas
    for concept in &analysis.concepts {
        let concept_context = EmbeddingContext::for_concept(
            &concept.description,
            &concept.concept_type,
            config
        );
        let concept_embedding = generate_zero_shot_bolted_text_embedding(
            &concept.description,
            &concept_context,
            llm
        ).await?;
        embeddings.add_concept_embedding(concept.id.clone(), concept_embedding);
    }
    
    Ok(embeddings)
}
```

Document-level embeddings provide a high-level representation that captures the overall character and content of the entire document. These are useful for document similarity comparisons and corpus-level analysis.

Section-level embeddings enable more targeted retrieval and analysis. Instead of treating a document as a monolithic unit, we can identify specific sections that are relevant to particular queries or interests.

Paragraph-level embeddings provide fine-grained access to specific information within documents. This level of granularity is particularly useful for question-answering systems and detailed content analysis.

Concept-level embeddings represent the key ideas and frameworks discussed in the document. These enable sophisticated queries about relationships between ideas and allow for concept-based search and analysis.

## Comprehensive Content Extraction Techniques

The methodology implements sophisticated content extraction that goes beyond simple text extraction to preserve meaning, structure, and relationships.

### Multi-Format Content Extraction

Different document formats require different extraction approaches to preserve important structural and semantic information.

```rust
pub fn extract_document_content(
    document_path: &Path,
    extraction_config: &ExtractionConfig
) -> Result<ExtractedContent> {
    // First, determine what kind of document we're dealing with
    let format = detect_document_format(document_path)?;
    
    // Select the appropriate extractor for this format
    let extractor = get_content_extractor(format)?;
    
    // Extract the raw content while preserving structure
    let raw_content = extractor.extract(document_path)?;
    
    // Parse and normalize the content structure
    let structure = parse_content_structure(&raw_content, format, extraction_config)?;
    
    // Extract metadata from the document
    let metadata = extract_document_metadata(document_path, format)?;
    
    // Extract structured elements like tables and figures
    let tables = extract_tables(&raw_content, format, extraction_config)?;
    let figures = extract_figures(&raw_content, format, extraction_config)?;
    
    // Extract citations and references
    let citations = extract_citations(&raw_content, format, extraction_config)?;
    let references = extract_references(&raw_content, format, extraction_config)?;
    
    // Create comprehensive extracted content structure
    let extracted_content = ExtractedContent {
        text: raw_content,
        structure,
        metadata,
        tables,
        figures,
        citations,
        references,
        format,
        extraction_quality: assess_extraction_quality(&raw_content, format)?,
    };
    
    Ok(extracted_content)
}
```

The extraction process begins with format detection that identifies the type of document and selects appropriate extraction strategies. PDF documents require different handling than Word documents, which require different handling than HTML documents.

Structure preservation is crucial for maintaining the meaning and organization of the original document. Headings, subheadings, paragraphs, lists, and other structural elements provide important context for understanding the content.

Metadata extraction captures information about the document's creation, authorship, and purpose. This metadata provides important context for analysis and helps with document organization and retrieval.

Special element extraction handles tables, figures, citations, and other structured content that requires special processing. These elements often contain crucial information that would be lost or misinterpreted if treated as plain text.

### Intelligent Text Preprocessing

Before analysis, extracted text undergoes intelligent preprocessing that cleans and normalizes the content while preserving important semantic information.

```rust
pub fn preprocess_extracted_text(
    extracted_content: &ExtractedContent,
    preprocessing_config: &PreprocessingConfig
) -> Result<PreprocessedContent> {
    let mut preprocessed = PreprocessedContent::new();
    
    // Clean the text by removing artifacts from the extraction process
    let cleaned_text = clean_extraction_artifacts(
        &extracted_content.text,
        &extracted_content.format,
        preprocessing_config
    )?;
    
    // Normalize formatting while preserving semantic structure
    let normalized_text = normalize_text_formatting(
        &cleaned_text,
        preprocessing_config
    )?;
    
    // Identify and preserve important structural markers
    let structural_markers = identify_structural_markers(
        &normalized_text,
        &extracted_content.structure,
        preprocessing_config
    )?;
    
    // Handle special characters and encoding issues
    let encoded_text = handle_character_encoding(
        &normalized_text,
        preprocessing_config
    )?;
    
    // Segment text into meaningful units (paragraphs, sections, etc.)
    let segmented_text = segment_text_content(
        &encoded_text,
        &structural_markers,
        preprocessing_config
    )?;
    
    // Create preprocessed content structure
    preprocessed.set_cleaned_text(segmented_text);
    preprocessed.set_structural_markers(structural_markers);
    preprocessed.set_preprocessing_log(create_preprocessing_log(&extracted_content, preprocessing_config));
    
    Ok(preprocessed)
}
```

Text cleaning removes artifacts that result from the extraction process, such as OCR errors, formatting remnants, or encoding issues. The cleaning process is careful to preserve semantic content while removing noise.

Formatting normalization standardizes text representation while preserving important structural elements. For example, different documents might use different conventions for representing headings, but the normalization process converts them to a standard representation.

Structural marker identification recognizes and preserves important organizational elements that provide context for understanding the content. These markers help maintain the logical flow and hierarchy of the original document.

Text segmentation divides the content into meaningful units that can be analyzed independently while maintaining awareness of their relationships within the larger document structure.

## Semantic Understanding Extraction

The methodology implements sophisticated semantic analysis that goes beyond keyword extraction to understand meaning, intent, and implications.

### Purpose and Intent Analysis

Understanding why a document was written and what it's trying to achieve is fundamental to proper analysis and appropriate response generation.

```rust
pub async fn analyze_document_purpose(
    document: &Document,
    context: &AnalysisContext,
    llm: &dyn Model
) -> Result<PurposeAnalysis> {
    // Create a prompt that helps the model understand what we're looking for
    let purpose_prompt = create_purpose_analysis_prompt(document, context);
    
    // Get the model's analysis of the document's purpose
    let purpose_response = llm.generate(&purpose_prompt).await?;
    
    // Parse the response to extract structured purpose information
    let primary_purpose = extract_primary_purpose(&purpose_response)?;
    let secondary_purposes = extract_secondary_purposes(&purpose_response)?;
    let target_outcomes = extract_target_outcomes(&purpose_response)?;
    let success_criteria = extract_success_criteria(&purpose_response)?;
    
    // Analyze the communicative strategy used to achieve the purpose
    let communicative_strategy = analyze_communicative_strategy(
        document,
        &primary_purpose,
        context,
        llm
    ).await?;
    
    // Assess how well the document achieves its stated purpose
    let purpose_achievement = assess_purpose_achievement(
        document,
        &primary_purpose,
        &target_outcomes,
        context,
        llm
    ).await?;
    
    // Create comprehensive purpose analysis
    let purpose_analysis = PurposeAnalysis {
        primary_purpose,
        secondary_purposes,
        target_outcomes,
        success_criteria,
        communicative_strategy,
        purpose_achievement,
        confidence_score: calculate_analysis_confidence(&purpose_response),
    };
    
    Ok(purpose_analysis)
}
```

Primary purpose identification focuses on the main reason the document exists. This might be to inform, persuade, instruct, entertain, or document. Understanding the primary purpose helps guide how we interpret and respond to the document.

Secondary purposes recognize that most documents serve multiple functions. A technical manual's primary purpose might be instruction, but it might also serve to establish credibility for the organization that produced it.

Target outcomes identify what the document author hopes to achieve in the reader. This might be understanding, behavior change, decision-making, or emotional response. Understanding target outcomes helps assess document effectiveness.

Communicative strategy analysis examines how the document goes about achieving its purpose. Does it use logical argument, emotional appeals, authoritative statements, step-by-step instruction, or narrative storytelling?

### Thematic Structure Analysis

Themes are the big ideas that run throughout a document, often implicit rather than explicitly stated. Understanding thematic structure provides insight into the document's deeper meaning and significance.

```rust
pub async fn analyze_document_themes(
    document: &Document,
    context: &AnalysisContext,
    config: &ThematicAnalysisConfig,
    llm: &dyn Model
) -> Result<ThematicAnalysis> {
    let mut thematic_analysis = ThematicAnalysis::new();
    
    // Identify major themes that run throughout the document
    let major_themes = identify_major_themes(document, context, config, llm).await?;
    thematic_analysis.set_major_themes(major_themes);
    
    // Identify minor themes that appear in specific sections
    let minor_themes = identify_minor_themes(document, context, config, llm).await?;
    thematic_analysis.set_minor_themes(minor_themes);
    
    // Analyze how themes are developed throughout the document
    let theme_development = analyze_theme_development(
        document,
        &thematic_analysis.major_themes,
        context,
        config,
        llm
    ).await?;
    thematic_analysis.set_theme_development(theme_development);
    
    // Identify relationships between different themes
    let theme_relationships = analyze_theme_relationships(
        &thematic_analysis.major_themes,
        &thematic_analysis.minor_themes,
        document,
        context,
        llm
    ).await?;
    thematic_analysis.set_theme_relationships(theme_relationships);
    
    // Analyze thematic coherence and consistency
    let thematic_coherence = analyze_thematic_coherence(
        &thematic_analysis,
        document,
        context,
        llm
    ).await?;
    thematic_analysis.set_coherence(thematic_coherence);
    
    // Generate thematic summary
    let thematic_summary = generate_thematic_summary(
        &thematic_analysis,
        config,
        llm
    ).await?;
    thematic_analysis.set_summary(thematic_summary);
    
    Ok(thematic_analysis)
}
```

Major theme identification looks for big ideas that are developed throughout the document. These themes often reflect the document's core concerns and values. A business report might have themes of growth, efficiency, and market adaptation.

Minor theme identification finds ideas that are important in specific sections but don't run throughout the entire document. These themes provide additional depth and nuance to the analysis.

Theme development analysis tracks how themes are introduced, developed, and resolved throughout the document. Some themes might be explicitly introduced early and systematically developed. Others might emerge gradually through accumulation of examples and evidence.

Theme relationship analysis examines how different themes interact with each other. Some themes might be complementary, working together to support the document's overall message. Others might be in tension, reflecting complexity or ambivalence in the subject matter.

### Concept Extraction and Analysis

Concepts are the building blocks of understanding within a document. Effective concept extraction identifies not just what concepts are mentioned, but how they're defined, used, and related to each other.

```rust
pub async fn extract_document_concepts(
    document: &Document,
    context: &AnalysisContext,
    config: &ConceptExtractionConfig,
    llm: &dyn Model
) -> Result<ConceptualAnalysis> {
    let mut conceptual_analysis = ConceptualAnalysis::new();
    
    // Identify key concepts mentioned in the document
    let key_concepts = identify_key_concepts(document, context, config, llm).await?;
    conceptual_analysis.set_key_concepts(key_concepts);
    
    // Extract definitions for concepts (both explicit and implicit)
    let concept_definitions = extract_concept_definitions(
        document,
        &conceptual_analysis.key_concepts,
        context,
        config,
        llm
    ).await?;
    conceptual_analysis.set_concept_definitions(concept_definitions);
    
    // Analyze how concepts are used throughout the document
    let concept_usage = analyze_concept_usage(
        document,
        &conceptual_analysis.key_concepts,
        context,
        config,
        llm
    ).await?;
    conceptual_analysis.set_concept_usage(concept_usage);
    
    // Map relationships between different concepts
    let concept_relationships = map_concept_relationships(
        &conceptual_analysis.key_concepts,
        document,
        context,
        config,
        llm
    ).await?;
    conceptual_analysis.set_concept_relationships(concept_relationships);
    
    // Identify conceptual frameworks used in the document
    let conceptual_frameworks = identify_conceptual_frameworks(
        &conceptual_analysis,
        document,
        context,
        config,
        llm
    ).await?;
    conceptual_analysis.set_conceptual_frameworks(conceptual_frameworks);
    
    // Assess conceptual coherence and consistency
    let conceptual_coherence = assess_conceptual_coherence(
        &conceptual_analysis,
        document,
        context,
        llm
    ).await?;
    conceptual_analysis.set_coherence(conceptual_coherence);
    
    Ok(conceptual_analysis)
}
```

Key concept identification recognizes the most important ideas that the document discusses. These might be explicitly defined terms or implicit concepts that are central to understanding the document's content.

Concept definition extraction captures both explicit definitions (where the document clearly states what a term means) and implicit definitions (where the meaning emerges from how the term is used in context).

Concept usage analysis tracks how concepts are employed throughout the document. Some concepts might be introduced once and then assumed. Others might be developed and refined throughout the discussion.

Concept relationship mapping identifies how different ideas connect to each other. Some relationships are hierarchical (concept A is a type of concept B), some are causal (concept A leads to concept B), and some are oppositional (concept A contrasts with concept B).

Conceptual framework identification recognizes the larger theoretical or practical frameworks that organize the document's thinking. These frameworks provide structure for understanding how individual concepts fit together into coherent systems of thought.

## Relationship Mapping and Network Analysis

Understanding how different parts of a document relate to each other, and how documents relate to other documents, is crucial for comprehensive analysis.

### Internal Document Relationships

Internal relationship mapping identifies how different sections, concepts, and arguments within a document connect to create a coherent whole.

```rust
pub async fn map_internal_document_relationships(
    document: &Document,
    semantic_analysis: &SemanticAnalysis,
    config: &RelationshipMappingConfig,
    llm: &dyn Model
) -> Result<InternalRelationshipMap> {
    let mut relationship_map = InternalRelationshipMap::new();
    
    // Map logical flow between sections
    let section_flow = map_section_logical_flow(
        document,
        semantic_analysis,
        config,
        llm
    ).await?;
    relationship_map.set_section_flow(section_flow);
    
    // Map argument structure and supporting relationships
    let argument_structure = map_argument_structure(
        document,
        semantic_analysis,
        config,
        llm
    ).await?;
    relationship_map.set_argument_structure(argument_structure);
    
    // Map concept development and refinement
    let concept_development = map_concept_development(
        document,
        semantic_analysis,
        config,
        llm
    ).await?;
    relationship_map.set_concept_development(concept_development);
    
    // Map evidence and support relationships
    let evidence_relationships = map_evidence_relationships(
        document,
        semantic_analysis,
        config,
        llm
    ).await?;
    relationship_map.set_evidence_relationships(evidence_relationships);
    
    // Map thematic connections across sections
    let thematic_connections = map_thematic_connections(
        document,
        semantic_analysis,
        config,
        llm
    ).await?;
    relationship_map.set_thematic_connections(thematic_connections);
    
    // Create relationship visualization
    let visualization = create_relationship_visualization(
        &relationship_map,
        config
    )?;
    relationship_map.set_visualization(visualization);
    
    Ok(relationship_map)
}
```

Section logical flow mapping tracks how the document moves from one idea to the next. This includes transitions, prerequisites, and dependencies between different parts of the document.

Argument structure mapping identifies how claims, evidence, and reasoning connect to support the document's conclusions. Even non-argumentative documents have implicit argumentative structures that can be mapped and analyzed.

Concept development mapping tracks how ideas are introduced, refined, and elaborated throughout the document. This helps understand the document's pedagogical or developmental strategy.

Evidence relationship mapping identifies how different pieces of information support or contradict each other within the document. This includes both explicit citations and implicit evidential relationships.

Thematic connection mapping identifies how the document's major themes are developed and connected across different sections. This helps understand the document's thematic coherence and development.

### Cross-Document Relationship Analysis

When analyzing collections of documents, understanding relationships between different documents provides valuable insights into larger patterns and trends.

```rust
pub async fn analyze_cross_document_relationships(
    target_document: &Document,
    document_corpus: &DocumentCorpus,
    config: &CrossDocumentAnalysisConfig,
    llm: &dyn Model
) -> Result<CrossDocumentRelationships> {
    let mut relationships = CrossDocumentRelationships::new();
    
    // Identify explicit citations and references
    let citation_relationships = identify_citation_relationships(
        target_document,
        document_corpus,
        config
    )?;
    relationships.set_citation_relationships(citation_relationships);
    
    // Identify thematic similarities and differences
    let thematic_relationships = analyze_thematic_relationships(
        target_document,
        document_corpus,
        config,
        llm
    ).await?;
    relationships.set_thematic_relationships(thematic_relationships);
    
    // Identify conceptual overlaps and distinctions
    let conceptual_relationships = analyze_conceptual_relationships(
        target_document,
        document_corpus,
        config,
        llm
    ).await?;
    relationships.set_conceptual_relationships(conceptual_relationships);
    
    // Identify methodological similarities and differences
    let methodological_relationships = analyze_methodological_relationships(
        target_document,
        document_corpus,
        config,
        llm
    ).await?;
    relationships.set_methodological_relationships(methodological_relationships);
    
    // Identify temporal relationships (chronological development)
    let temporal_relationships = analyze_temporal_relationships(
        target_document,
        document_corpus,

    // Create cross-document relationship visualization
    let visualization = create_cross_document_visualization(
        &relationships,

    Ok(relationships)
}
```

Citation relationship analysis identifies explicit references between documents and analyzes the nature of those relationships. Citations might be supportive, critical, or neutral, and understanding this helps map the intellectual landscape.

Thematic relationship analysis compares the major themes across documents to identify commonalities, contrasts, and complementary perspectives. This helps understand how different documents contribute to larger conversations.

Conceptual relationship analysis examines how different documents use and define key concepts. Some documents might use the same concepts with different definitions, while others might use different concepts to discuss similar ideas.

Methodological relationship analysis compares the approaches different documents take to similar problems or questions. This is particularly important in academic and technical documents.

Temporal relationship analysis tracks how ideas, approaches, and understanding develop over time across collections of documents. This helps identify trends, evolution, and paradigm shifts.

## Classification and Categorization Systems

Comprehensive document classification enables appropriate processing, analysis, and response generation by identifying the document's type, purpose, audience, and characteristics.

### Multi-Dimensional Document Classification

Document classification in the ZSEI methodology considers multiple dimensions simultaneously to create a comprehensive understanding of the document's character and purpose.

```rust
pub async fn classify_document_comprehensively(
    document: &Document,
    analysis: &DocumentAnalysis,
    config: &ClassificationConfig,
    llm: &dyn Model
) -> Result<ComprehensiveClassification> {
    let mut classification = ComprehensiveClassification::new();
    
    // Classify by functional category
    let functional_category = classify_functional_category(
        document,
        analysis,
        config,
        llm
    ).await?;
    classification.set_functional_category(functional_category);
    
    // Classify by genre within category
    let genre_classification = classify_document_genre(
        document,
        analysis,
        &functional_category,
        config,
        llm
    ).await?;
    classification.set_genre(genre_classification);
    
    // Classify by target audience
    let audience_classification = classify_target_audience(
        document,
        analysis,
        config,
        llm
    ).await?;
    classification.set_audience(audience_classification);
    
    // Classify by complexity level
    let complexity_classification = classify_complexity_level(
        document,
        analysis,
        config
    )?;
    classification.set_complexity(complexity_classification);
    
    // Classify by formality level
    let formality_classification = classify_formality_level(
        document,
        analysis,
        config
    )?;
    classification.set_formality(formality_classification);
    
    // Classify by domain expertise required
    let expertise_classification = classify_expertise_level(
        document,
        analysis,
        config,
        llm
    ).await?;
    classification.set_expertise_level(expertise_classification);
    
    // Classify by writing style
    let style_classification = classify_writing_style(
        document,
        analysis,
        config,
        llm
    ).await?;
    classification.set_writing_style(style_classification);
    
    // Generate classification confidence scores
    let confidence_scores = calculate_classification_confidence(
        &classification,
        document,
        analysis,
        config
    )?;
    classification.set_confidence_scores(confidence_scores);
    
    Ok(classification)
}
```

Functional category classification determines the primary purpose the document serves in the world. Academic documents serve different functions than business documents, legal documents, or creative works. Understanding function helps guide analysis and response strategies.

Genre classification provides more specific categorization within functional categories. Within academic documents, research papers require different handling than literature reviews, which require different handling than theoretical essays.

Audience classification identifies who the document is written for and what assumptions it makes about readers' knowledge, interests, and needs. Documents written for experts use different language and make different assumptions than documents written for general audiences.

Complexity classification evaluates multiple dimensions of difficulty including vocabulary, sentence structure, conceptual sophistication, and reasoning complexity. This information guides how the document should be processed and presented.

Formality classification assesses the document's level of formality and adherence to conventional standards. This affects appropriate response styles and processing approaches.

Expertise level classification determines how much domain-specific knowledge readers need to understand the document effectively. This guides explanation strategies and identifies concepts that might need additional context.

Writing style classification recognizes the communication approach and conventions used by the document. Different styles have different strengths and limitations and require different analytical approaches.

### Domain-Specific Classification

Different domains have their own classification systems and conventions that the methodology can recognize and apply appropriately.

```rust
pub async fn apply_domain_specific_classification(
    document: &Document,
    base_classification: &ComprehensiveClassification,
    config: &DomainClassificationConfig,
    llm: &dyn Model
) -> Result<DomainSpecificClassification> {
    // Determine the primary domain of the document
    let primary_domain = identify_primary_domain(
        document,
        base_classification,
        config,
        llm
    ).await?;
    
    // Apply domain-specific classification based on the identified domain
    let domain_classification = match primary_domain {
        Domain::Academic => classify_academic_document(document, base_classification, config, llm).await?,
        Domain::Business => classify_business_document(document, base_classification, config, llm).await?,
        Domain::Legal => classify_legal_document(document, base_classification, config, llm).await?,
        Domain::Technical => classify_technical_document(document, base_classification, config, llm).await?,
        Domain::Creative => classify_creative_document(document, base_classification, config, llm).await?,
        Domain::Journalistic => classify_journalistic_document(document, base_classification, config, llm).await?,
        Domain::Government => classify_government_document(document, base_classification, config, llm).await?,
        Domain::Medical => classify_medical_document(document, base_classification, config, llm).await?,
    };
    
    Ok(domain_classification)
}
```

Academic domain classification recognizes conventions like research papers, literature reviews, theoretical essays, dissertations, and conference papers. Each has specific structural and content conventions that affect analysis approaches.

Business domain classification identifies documents like reports, proposals, memos, strategic plans, and marketing materials. Business documents have specific purposes and evaluation criteria that differ from academic or creative documents.

Legal domain classification recognizes contracts, briefs, opinions, statutes, and regulations. Legal documents have strict accuracy requirements and specific interpretation frameworks.

Technical domain classification identifies manuals, specifications, procedures, and documentation. Technical documents prioritize precision, completeness, and usability.

Creative domain classification recognizes stories, poems, essays, and other artistic works. Creative documents use different evaluation criteria and require different analytical approaches.

    analysis: &DocumentAnalysis,
    config: &ValidationConfig,
    llm: &dyn Model
) -> Result<ValidationReport> {
    let mut validation_report = ValidationReport::new();
    
    // Validate analysis completeness
    let completeness_validation = validate_analysis_completeness(
        document,
        analysis,
        config
    )?;
    validation_report.set_completeness_validation(completeness_validation);
    
    // Validate analysis accuracy
    let accuracy_validation = validate_analysis_accuracy(
        document,
        analysis,
        config,
        llm
    ).await?;
    validation_report.set_accuracy_validation(accuracy_validation);
    
    // Validate analysis consistency
    let consistency_validation = validate_analysis_consistency(
        analysis,
        config
    )?;
    validation_report.set_consistency_validation(consistency_validation);
    
    // Validate embedding quality
    let embedding_validation = validate_embedding_quality(
        document,
        analysis,
        config
    )?;
    validation_report.set_embedding_validation(embedding_validation);
    
    // Validate relationship mapping
    let relationship_validation = validate_relationship_mapping(
        document,
        analysis,
        config,
        llm
    ).await?;
    validation_report.set_relationship_validation(relationship_validation);
    
    // Generate overall quality score
    let quality_score = calculate_overall_quality_score(
        &validation_report
    )?;
    validation_report.set_quality_score(quality_score);
    
    Ok(validation_report)
}
```

Completeness validation ensures that all required analysis components have been generated and that no important aspects have been missed. This includes checking that all document sections have been analyzed and that all required relationship types have been identified.

Accuracy validation checks that analysis results correctly represent the document content. This might involve sampling analysis results and comparing them against the original document to ensure accuracy.

Consistency validation ensures that analysis results are internally consistent and don't contain contradictions. For example, if the document is classified as highly formal, the writing style analysis should be consistent with that classification.

Embedding quality validation ensures that generated embeddings accurately represent the content they're supposed to represent. This might involve testing whether similar content produces similar embeddings.

Relationship mapping validation ensures that identified relationships actually exist in the document and are correctly characterized. This involves checking that mapped relationships can be verified by examining the source content.
