# Implementation Plan Guideline

## Purpose

The Implementation Plan serves as your detailed blueprint for executing codebase updates. It specifies exactly what needs to be changed, how to change it, and provides the technical specifications for each modification. This document bridges the gap between high-level requirements and actual code changes, ensuring all developers have a clear, shared understanding of what needs to be built.

## Creation Timing

Create an Implementation Plan when you need to:
- Add new features to an existing codebase
- Refactor existing functionality
- Fix complex bugs requiring structural changes
- Integrate new dependencies or technologies
- Upgrade system architecture
- After completing breakdown analysis documents (BREAKDOWN.md, etc.)
- As the first document in the implementation phase

## Document Structure

### 1. Update Overview

Begin with a comprehensive summary that explains:
- The purpose and scope of the update
- Key objectives to be achieved
- Expected impact on the existing system
- Any breaking changes or compatibility considerations
- Architectural principles being applied
- Timeline expectations and resource requirements

Example format:

```markdown
## Update Overview

This implementation plan outlines the changes needed to implement Dual-DAG architecture support in the Aevor blockchain, enhancing block structure to support micro-DAG transaction dependencies and progressive security levels. The changes will affect core block processing, consensus mechanisms, and storage layers.

### Key Objectives:
- Enable parallel transaction execution through micro-DAG dependency tracking
- Implement tiered security level progression (Minimal → Basic → Strong → Full)
- Add support for transaction superposition states
- Enhance block storage to accommodate new data structures
- Update consensus mechanisms to utilize new block structure

### System Impact:
- Core data structures will be enhanced but maintain backward compatibility
- API responses will include additional fields for new features
- Storage layer will require database schema updates
- Consensus will maintain compatibility with previous protocol version

### Breaking Changes:
- Block serialization format will change (migration tool provided)
- Minimum protocol version requirement will increase to v0.8.0
- Full validation of micro-DAG dependencies requires updated nodes
```

### 2. Current State Analysis

Provide a clear description of the current implementation:
- Brief description of the existing architecture
- Key components and their current behavior
- Limitations or issues driving the need for change
- Performance characteristics of the current implementation
- Reference to detailed breakdown documents for more information

Example:

```markdown
## Current State Analysis

The current block processing system uses a linear chain structure where each block references a single parent block. Transactions within a block are processed sequentially without parallelization. Security is binary (valid/invalid) without progressive confirmation levels.

### Key Limitations:
- Sequential transaction processing limits throughput to ~50,000 TPS
- Single-parent chain limits parallelism in block production
- Binary security model doesn't allow for graduated trust levels
- No support for transaction superposition or advanced conflict resolution

### Current Architecture:
- Block: Contains a list of transactions with single-parent reference
- Transaction: Simple data structure with inputs, outputs, and signature
- Consensus: Basic Proof-of-Stake with single-level validation
- Storage: Flat key-value structure for blocks and transactions
```

### 3. Requirements Analysis

Document the specific requirements driving the update:
- Functional requirements (what the system must do)
- Non-functional requirements (performance, security, scalability)
- Technical constraints and limitations
- Dependencies on other systems or components
- Backward compatibility requirements
- Testing and validation requirements

Example:

```markdown
## Requirements Analysis

### Functional Requirements:
- Support for multi-parent block references in the DAG structure
- Parallel transaction execution based on dependency analysis
- Four distinct security levels with clear thresholds
- Superposition state support for conflicting transactions
- Dynamic adjustment of security levels based on validation count

### Non-functional Requirements:
- Throughput: Support 200,000+ TPS under normal conditions
- Latency: Achieve 20-50ms for initial confirmation
- Finality: Strong security level (<1s) for high-value transactions
- Backward Compatibility: Support nodes with previous version
- Resource Usage: Limit memory increase to 20% over current version

### Technical Constraints:
- Must work with existing cryptographic primitives
- Must support current transaction signature format
- Storage engine must remain compatible with RocksDB
- Network protocol must be backward compatible
- Must work on existing validator hardware specifications
```

### 4. Detailed Technical Specifications

For each component being modified, provide:
- Current state description (with code examples)
- Proposed changes (with complete code examples)
- New data structures or types to be added
- Modified function signatures
- API changes and their impact
- Database schema changes if applicable
- Configuration changes

Example:

```markdown

### Block Structure Enhancement

#### Current Block Structure:
```rust
pub struct Block {
    header: BlockHeader,
    transactions: Vec<Transaction>,
    // ... existing fields
}
```

#### Enhanced Block Structure:
```rust
pub struct Block {
    header: BlockHeader,
    transactions: Vec<Transaction>,
    // ... existing fields

    // New fields for micro-DAG support
    micro_dag_dependencies: HashMap<Vec<u8>, Vec<Vec<u8>>>,
    execution_paths: Vec<Vec<Vec<u8>>>,
    execution_metrics: Option<BlockExecutionMetrics>,
    security_level: BlockSecurityLevel,
}

/// Security level of a block
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy, PartialEq, Eq, Hash, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub enum BlockSecurityLevel {
    /// Minimal security (single validator)
    Minimal,
    /// Basic security (10-20% validators)
    Basic,
    /// Strong security (>1/3 validators)
    Strong,
    /// Full security (>2/3 validators)
    Full,
}

/// Metrics for block execution
#[derive(Clone, Serialize, Deserialize, Debug)]
pub struct BlockExecutionMetrics {
    /// Parallelism achieved during execution (0.0-1.0)
    pub parallelism_factor: f64,
    /// Number of parallel execution paths
    pub execution_path_count: usize,
    /// Max dependency depth in the micro-DAG

    pub avg_tx_execution_time_ms: f64,
    /// Total execution time in milliseconds
    pub total_execution_time_ms: u64,
}
```

### Block Functions Enhancement

#### New Methods to Add:
```rust
impl Block {
    /// Builds the micro-DAG from transaction dependencies
    pub fn build_micro_dag(&mut self) -> Result<()> {
        let mut dependencies = HashMap::new();

        // Extract dependencies from transactions
        for tx in &self.transactions {
            let tx_hash = tx.hash();

            // Add explicit dependencies from transaction
            for dep in tx.dependencies() {
                dependencies
                    .entry(dep.tx_hash().to_vec())
                    .or_insert_with(Vec::new)
                    .push(tx_hash.clone());
            }
        }

        // Compute implicit dependencies based on object access patterns
        for (i, tx1) in self.transactions.iter().enumerate() {
            let tx1_hash = tx1.hash();
            let tx1_reads = tx1.read_set();
            let tx1_writes = tx1.write_set();

            for (j, tx2) in self.transactions.iter().enumerate() {
                if i == j {
                    continue; // Skip self comparison
                }

                let tx2_hash = tx2.hash();
                let tx2_reads = tx2.read_set();
                let tx2_writes = tx2.write_set();

                // Check for Read-After-Write dependency
                for obj_id in tx1_reads {
                    if tx2_writes.contains(obj_id) {
                        dependencies
                            .entry(tx2_hash.clone())
                            .or_insert_with(Vec::new())
                            .push(tx1_hash.clone());
                    }
                }

                // Check for Write-After-Write dependency
                for obj_id in tx1_writes {
                    if tx2_writes.contains(obj_id) {
                        dependencies
                            .entry(tx2_hash.clone())
                            .or_insert_with(Vec::new())
                            .push(tx1_hash.clone());
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        self.micro_dag_dependencies = dependencies;

        // Calculate execution paths
        self.calculate_execution_paths()?;

        Ok(())
    }

    // Additional new methods...
}
```
```

### 5. Implementation Details

Provide step-by-step implementation guidance:
- File-by-file changes
- New methods to add with full implementations
- Existing methods to modify
- Order of changes and dependencies between them
- Code snippets with context
- Implementation notes and considerations
- Common pitfalls to avoid

Example:

```markdown
## Implementation Details

### Step 1: Define New Types and Enums
Add the following new types to `core/block/types.rs`:

```rust
/// Security level of a block
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy, PartialEq, Eq, Hash, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub enum BlockSecurityLevel {
    /// Minimal security (single validator)
    Minimal,
    /// Basic security (10-20% validators)
    Basic,
    /// Strong security (>1/3 validators)
    Strong,
    /// Full security (>2/3 validators)
    Full,
}

impl Default for BlockSecurityLevel {
    fn default() -> Self {
        BlockSecurityLevel::Minimal
    }
}

/// Metrics for block execution
#[derive(Clone, Serialize, Deserialize, Debug)]
pub struct BlockExecutionMetrics {
    /// Parallelism achieved during execution (0.0-1.0)
    pub parallelism_factor: f64,
    /// Number of parallel execution paths
    pub execution_path_count: usize,
    /// Max dependency depth in the micro-DAG
    pub max_dependency_depth: usize,
    /// Average transaction execution time in milliseconds
    pub avg_tx_execution_time_ms: f64,
    /// Total execution time in milliseconds
    pub total_execution_time_ms: u64,
    /// Execution time breakdown by component
    pub execution_time_breakdown: HashMap<String, u64>, // component -> time_ms
}
```

Implementation notes:
- These types should be public and exported from the module
- Add appropriate derives for serialization support
- Default security level should be Minimal to maintain compatibility

### Step 2: Enhance Block Structure in `core/block/mod.rs`
Modify the Block struct to add the new fields:

```rust
pub struct Block {
    // Existing fields...

    /// Micro-DAG transaction dependencies (tx_hash -> dependent_tx_hashes)
    micro_dag_dependencies: HashMap<Vec<u8>, Vec<Vec<u8>>>,

    /// Parallel execution paths for transactions
    execution_paths: Vec<Vec<Vec<u8>>>,

    /// Block execution metrics
    execution_metrics: Option<BlockExecutionMetrics>,

    /// Current security level of the block
    security_level: BlockSecurityLevel,

    /// Objects created by this block
    created_objects: Vec<ObjectID>,

    /// Objects modified by this block
    modified_objects: Vec<ObjectID>,

    /// Objects deleted by this block
    deleted_objects: Vec<ObjectID>,
}
```

Also modify the Block::new method to initialize these new fields:

```rust
pub fn new(header: BlockHeader, transactions: Vec<Transaction>) -> Self {
    // Existing code...

    Self {
        // Existing fields...

        // New fields
        micro_dag_dependencies: HashMap::new(),
        execution_paths: Vec::new(),
        execution_metrics: None,
        security_level: BlockSecurityLevel::Minimal,
        created_objects: Vec::new(),
        modified_objects: Vec::new(),
        deleted_objects: Vec::new(),
    }
}
```

### Step 3: Implement Micro-DAG Functions
Add the following methods to the Block implementation:

```rust
impl Block {
    // Existing code...

    /// Gets the micro-DAG dependencies
    pub fn micro_dag_dependencies(&self) -> &HashMap<Vec<u8>, Vec<Vec<u8>>> {
        &self.micro_dag_dependencies
    }

    /// Gets a mutable reference to the micro-DAG dependencies
    pub fn micro_dag_dependencies_mut(&mut self) -> &mut HashMap<Vec<u8>, Vec<Vec<u8>>> {
        &mut self.micro_dag_dependencies
    }

    /// Adds a micro-DAG dependency
    pub fn add_micro_dag_dependency(&mut self, tx_hash: Vec<u8>, dependent_tx_hash: Vec<u8>) {
        self.micro_dag_dependencies
            .entry(tx_hash)
            .or_insert_with(Vec::new)
            .push(dependent_tx_hash);
    }

    // ... Additional methods here ...
}
```

Implementation notes:
- Ensure all new fields have appropriate getter/setter methods
- Maintain immutability where possible by returning references
- Provide mutable access only where necessary
```

### 6. Integration Points

Document how changes integrate with existing systems:
- Module dependencies and their impact
- API contract changes and backward compatibility
- Database schema updates and migrations
- Configuration changes and defaults
- Integration test requirements
- Cross-team coordination points

Example:

```markdown
## Integration Points

### Module Dependencies
The enhanced Block structure will affect these modules:

1. `core/block` - Direct changes to the Block structure
2. `storage/blockchain` - Changes to block serialization and storage
3. `consensus/dag_manager` - Utilize micro-DAG for validation
4. `api/routes/blocks` - Enhanced block information in API responses
5. `execution/engine` - Parallel execution using DAG information

### API Changes
The Block API response will include new fields:

```json
{
  "block": {
    // Existing fields...
    "security_level": "Strong",
    "execution_metrics": {
      "parallelism_factor": 0.82,
      "execution_path_count": 5,
      "max_dependency_depth": 3,
      "avg_tx_execution_time_ms": 0.42,
      "total_execution_time_ms": 12
    }
  }
}
```

For backward compatibility:
- These fields will be optional in the API schema
- Old clients will ignore the new fields
- New clients must handle missing fields from old nodes

### Database Updates
The block storage schema will be updated to include new column families:

- `micro_dag_cf`: Stores block micro-DAG dependencies
- `execution_metrics_cf`: Stores block execution metrics
- `block_security_level_cf`: Stores block security level

Database migration will be provided through the `db_migrate` tool.
```

### 7. Migration Strategy

If the update requires data migration:
- Migration steps in detail
- Rollback procedures and safeguards
- Data validation checks before and after
- Performance considerations during migration
- Backward compatibility during transition

Example:

```markdown
## Migration Strategy

### Database Migration
To update existing blocks in the database:

1. Add the new column families to the database:
   ```
   db.create_column_family("micro_dag_cf");
   db.create_column_family("execution_metrics_cf");
   db.create_column_family("block_security_level_cf");
   ```

2. For each existing block:
   - Load the block from the database
   - Build the micro-DAG for the block using the new `build_micro_dag()` method
   - Calculate the security level based on existing confirmations
   - Store the updated block with the new fields

3. Migration Tool:
   The `db_migrate` tool will be enhanced with a `--update-blocks` option that performs this migration automatically.

### Rollback Procedure
If issues are detected:

1. Keep old column families during migration
2. Run migration in read-only mode first to validate
3. Create backup before modifying data
4. Provide `--rollback` option in migration tool

### Performance Considerations
- Migration should be run during low-traffic periods
- Process blocks in batches of 1000 to limit memory usage
- Estimated migration time: ~30 minutes for 1 million blocks
```

### 8. Testing Requirements

Specify testing needs:
- Unit test requirements for new components
- Integration test scenarios
- Performance benchmarks and targets
- Acceptance criteria
- Regression test suites
- Test environment requirements

Example:

```markdown
## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests
Add the following unit tests:

1. `BlockSecurityLevel` tests:
   - Test default value
   - Test serialization/deserialization
   - Test comparisons and ordering

2. `Block::build_micro_dag()` tests:
   - Test with empty transactions
   - Test with independent transactions
   - Test with dependent transactions
   - Test with complex dependency graph
   - Test with circular dependencies (should detect and handle)

3. `Block::calculate_execution_paths()` tests:
   - Test path calculation with various dependency patterns
   - Verify optimal parallelism is achieved
   - Test with pathological cases (long chains, wide branches)

### Integration Tests
Add the following integration tests:

1. DAG Processing Flow:
   - Create blocks with various transaction patterns
   - Verify micro-DAG is built correctly
   - Verify execution paths are optimal
   - Test both implicit and explicit dependencies

2. Security Level Progression:
   - Test security level updates as confirmations arrive
   - Verify thresholds for each security level
   - Test behavior with validator set changes

### Performance Benchmarks
The implementation must achieve:

1. Transaction Processing:
   - >200,000 TPS with typical transaction mix
   - >1,000,000 TPS in burst mode

2. Latency Targets:
   - Minimal security: 20-50ms
   - Basic security: 100-200ms
   - Strong security: 500-800ms
   - Full security: <1s

3. Resource Usage:
   - Memory: <20% increase over baseline
   - CPU: <30% increase over baseline
   - Storage: <10% increase for equivalent data
```

### 9. Rollout Plan

Describe the deployment approach:
- Phased rollout strategy
- Feature flag management
- Monitoring requirements
- Rollback procedures
- User communication plan
- Support plan for transition period

Example:

```markdown
## Rollout Plan

### 11. Risks and Mitigation

Identify potential risks and mitigation strategies:
- Technical risks and fallback approaches
- Performance risks and optimization strategies
- Security risks and safeguards
- Integration risks and testing plans
- Resource risks and contingency plans

Example:

```markdown
## Risks and Mitigation

### Technical Risks

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Circular dependencies causing execution failures | High | Medium | Implement cycle detection in DAG building; fall back to sequential execution if cycles found |
| Memory usage spikes with large transaction blocks | High | Medium | Implement streaming DAG building; set sensible limits on block size |
| Improper parallelization causing race conditions | Critical | Low | Extensive unit testing; formal verification of critical paths; feature flag to disable parallel execution |

### Performance Risks

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| DAG building becomes bottleneck for large blocks | Medium | High | Optimize DAG algorithm; implement incremental building; consider parallel DAG construction |
| Security level progression too slow for high-value transactions | Medium | Medium | Implement validator topology awareness; prioritize important blocks for validation |
| Block size increases impact network propagation | Medium | Medium | Implement compression for DAG storage; optimize serialization format |

### Integration Risks

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| API clients break with new response format | Medium | Low | Ensure backward compatibility; version the API; document changes clearly |
| Database migration fails on large datasets | High | Medium | Comprehensive testing with production-scale data; backup procedures; dry-run option |
