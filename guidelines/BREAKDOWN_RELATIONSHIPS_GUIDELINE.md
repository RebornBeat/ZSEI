# BREAKDOWN_RELATIONSHIPS.md Guideline

## Purpose
The purpose of BREAKDOWN_RELATIONSHIPS.md is to provide a detailed overview of the relationships and dependencies between components within the codebase. This document maps the interconnections across different levels of abstraction (modules, groups, files) to help developers understand system coupling, identify potential refactoring opportunities, and predict the impact of changes.

## Creation Timing
Create BREAKDOWN_RELATIONSHIPS.md:
- After completing the initial BREAKDOWN.md
- When planning significant architectural changes
- When dependencies need to be optimized or rationalized
- When preparing for large-scale refactoring efforts
- As part of the evaluation phase in implementation planning

## Structure

### 1. Executive Summary
- Overview of key dependency patterns and architectural insights
- Summary of dependency health (coupling metrics, circular dependencies)
- High-level overview of system boundaries and integration points
- Architectural recommendations based on relationship analysis

Example:
```
# Relationship Analysis for [Project Name]

## Executive Summary
This analysis identified 3 primary dependency clusters in the codebase:
1. Core Engine (highly cohesive, low external dependencies)
2. API Layer (moderate coupling with Data Access)
3. Service Integrations (high external coupling)

Key findings:
- 2 circular dependencies requiring attention (user ↔ authentication)
- Core modules have appropriate encapsulation (92% cohesion metric)
- Service layer shows signs of responsibility diffusion (4 modules with overlapping concerns)
```

### 2. Visualization
- Include dependency graphs showing relationships between components
- Use different visualization levels (high-level for modules, detailed for specific areas)
- Highlight critical paths and bottlenecks
- Mark circular dependencies and highly coupled areas

For example:
```
## System Dependency Graph
```
[Include a diagram showing module dependencies with arrow directions]
```
## Data Flow Diagram
```
[Include a diagram showing how data flows through the system]

### 3. Module-level Dependencies
- List each module and its dependencies on other modules
- Identify the specific files within each module that have dependencies on files from other modules
- Quantify the strength of dependencies (number of connections, frequency of calls)
- Document the direction of dependencies (who depends on whom)
- Note the purpose or nature of each dependency (data access, functionality, configuration)

Example format:
```
## Module: authentication
Depends on:
  - database (for user storage)
    - Files: auth/login.rs uses database/users.rs
    - Purpose: Retrieval and storage of user credentials
    - Strength: Strong (8 connection points)

  - crypto (for password hashing)
    - Files: auth/password.rs uses crypto/hash.rs
    - Purpose: Securely hash and verify passwords
    - Strength: Moderate (3 connection points)

Depended on by:
  - api (for user verification)
    - Files: api/middleware.rs uses auth/session.rs
    - Purpose: Verify user sessions for protected endpoints
    - Strength: Strong (12 connection points)
```

### 4. Group-level Dependencies
- Within each module, identify logical groups based on functionality
- Document dependencies between these functional groups
- Analyze cross-cutting concerns that span multiple groups
- Identify opportunities for better encapsulation or refactoring

Example:
```
## Module: blockchain
### Group: Consensus
Purpose: Handles block validation and consensus rules
Dependencies:
  - Internal: BlockStorage (for chain state retrieval)
  - External: Networking (for peer communication)

### Group: Transaction Processing
Purpose: Manages transaction validation and execution
Dependencies:
  - Internal: Mempool (for pending transaction retrieval)
  - External: Storage (for state updates)

Cross-cutting concerns:
- Cryptographic verification spans both groups
- Configuration parameters affect behavior of both groups
```

### 5. File-level Dependencies
- For critical paths or areas of concern, document file-level dependencies
- List the specific imports, includes, or requires between files
- Identify the specific functions or components within each file that create dependencies
- Note any conditional dependencies (only used in certain configurations)

Example:
```
## File: src/consensus/validator.rs
Imports:
  - src/types/block.rs: Block, BlockHeader
  - src/crypto/hash.rs: hash_block, verify_signature
  - src/config/chain_params.rs: ChainParameters

Imported by:
  - src/api/routes/blocks.rs: For block validation
  - src/consensus/chain.rs: For adding blocks to chain
  - src/miner/block_producer.rs: For pre-validation

Key dependencies:
- Relies on ChainParameters for validation rules
- Requires Block structure to match serialization format
```

### 6. Dependency Direction Analysis
- Analyze the direction of dependencies (upstream vs. downstream)
- Identify and document layering violations (e.g., core modules depending on UI)
- Suggest improvements to maintain clean architecture
- Document dependency inversion opportunities

Example:
```
## Layering Analysis
Current layers (from lowest to highest):
1. Core (domain models, business logic)
2. Services (application services)
3. Infrastructure (external integrations)
4. Presentation (UI, API)

Layering violations:
- Core directly depends on Infrastructure (database models) in user/account.rs
- Services directly reference Presentation types in order/processing.rs

Recommendations:
- Introduce repository interfaces in Core
- Create DTOs to decouple Services from Presentation
```

### 7. Dependency Type Analysis
- Categorize dependencies by type:
  - Data dependencies (shared data structures)
  - Functional dependencies (function calls)
  - Inheritance/implementation dependencies
  - Configuration dependencies
  - Event-based dependencies
- Identify potential areas for decoupling or interface extraction

Example:
```
## Dependency Types in Authentication Module

Data Dependencies:
- UserCredentials (shared between login.rs and user_profile.rs)
- SessionToken (shared across 7 files)

Functional Dependencies:
- hash_password() used by 4 different modules
- verify_session() called from 12 different locations

Event Dependencies:
- UserLoggedInEvent triggers actions in 3 different modules
- PasswordChangedEvent affects session management

Recommendations:
- Extract SessionToken management into dedicated module
- Create event mediator to reduce direct coupling
```

### 8. Criticality and Impact Assessment
- Assess the criticality of each dependency relationship
- Identify dependencies that are critical for the system's core functionality
- Document the potential impact of changes to each component
- Create a risk matrix for dependencies

Example:
```
## Criticality Matrix

| Component         | Dependents | Criticality | Change Impact | Risk |
|-------------------|------------|-------------|---------------|------|
| Database Schema   | 14 modules | Very High   | System-wide   | High |
| Auth Service      | 8 modules  | High        | Security-wide | High |
| Config Manager    | 12 modules | Medium      | System-wide   | Med  |
| UI Components     | 3 modules  | Low         | Isolated      | Low  |

High-risk dependencies requiring special attention:
1. Database Schema changes (consider versioning strategy)
2. Auth Service API changes (require coordinated updates)
```

### 9. Circular Dependencies
- Identify and document all circular dependencies
- Analyze the nature and cause of each circular dependency
- Suggest strategies for breaking circular dependencies
- Prioritize circular dependencies for resolution

Example:
```
## Circular Dependencies

1. user.rs ↔ authentication.rs
   Nature: User needs Authentication for validation, Authentication needs User for lookup
   Impact: Complicates testing, creates initialization order problems
   Resolution Strategy: Extract authentication interface, use dependency injection

2. order.rs ↔ product.rs ↔ inventory.rs
   Nature: Three-way circular dependency through order processing
   Impact: Changes in any component require testing all three
   Resolution Strategy: Extract OrderProcessingService to mediate interactions
```

### 10. Potential Optimizations
- Identify unnecessary or redundant dependencies
- Suggest potential refactorings to simplify the dependency structure
- Document opportunities for better modularization
- Propose interface extraction to reduce coupling

Example:
```
## Optimization Opportunities

1. Consolidate Logging Dependencies
   Current: 4 different logging implementations across modules
   Proposal: Extract common logging interface, implement adapter pattern

2. Reduce Database Coupling
   Current: 80% of modules directly depend on database models
   Proposal: Introduce repository pattern, decouple database implementation

3. Simplify Configuration Access
   Current: Direct access to configuration in 24 files
   Proposal: Introduce configuration providers for specific subsystems
```

### 11. Evolution and Trends
- Track dependency changes over time (if historical data is available)
- Identify trends in coupling and cohesion
- Document the impact of previous refactorings on dependencies
- Project future dependency patterns based on the roadmap

Example:
```
## Dependency Evolution

Coupling metrics over time:
- January 2023: 0.67 (initial architecture)
- June 2023: 0.58 (after service extraction)
- December 2023: 0.62 (after new features added)

Trends:
- Authentication dependencies increasing (5 new dependents in 6 months)
- Storage abstraction successfully reduced database coupling (12 direct dependencies removed)
- API layer becoming more fragmented (cohesion decreased 15%)

Projected impacts:
- Planned microservice transition will require breaking 14 direct dependencies
- UI modernization will affect 30% of current component relationships
```
