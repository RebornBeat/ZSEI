# Implementation Tracking Dashboard Guideline

## Purpose

The Implementation Tracking Dashboard provides a centralized, visual representation of implementation progress, quality metrics, and key issues. It serves as the single source of truth for implementation status, enabling stakeholders to quickly understand progress, identify blockers, and make informed decisions. The dashboard transforms complex implementation data into actionable insights, promoting transparency and accountability throughout the implementation process.

## Creation Timing

Create an Implementation Tracking Dashboard when:
- Beginning a significant implementation project
- Planning to implement complex changes across multiple components
- Multiple team members or teams will be working on implementation
- Progress needs to be visible to stakeholders at various levels
- You need early identification of implementation risks and issues
- You want to ensure consistent quality throughout implementation
- After creating initial implementation planning documents

## Core Dashboard Components

### 1. Executive Summary

Provide a high-level overview of implementation status:

- Overall progress percentage and status
- Key metrics summary
- Critical blockers or risks
- Timeline status (ahead/on-track/behind)
- Next major milestones

```markdown
