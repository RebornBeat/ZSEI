# ZSEI
ZSEI is a powerful tool for analyzing, indexing, and optimizing code that leverages Small Language Models (SLMs) and/or Large Language Models (LLMs) for enhanced understanding. Using a "zero-shot bolted embedding" approach, it can provide deep insights into your codebase without requiring extensive training data.
